### Shared Statuses Mapping to Client Cluster
| Training Cluster event_type | Client Cluster state |
|-----------------------------|----------------------|
| training                    | IN_PROGRESS          |
| training_successful         | READY                |
| training_failed             | FAILED               |

### Internal (Not Mapped)
| Training Cluster event_type | Client Cluster state |
|-----------------------------|----------------------|
| in_queue                    | (Not reflected)      |
| model_in_transfer           | (Not reflected)      |

Callbacks will only send the shared statuses (IN_PROGRESS, READY, FAILED) as per the clientâ€™s expectations.
